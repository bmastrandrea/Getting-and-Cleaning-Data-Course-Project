The file Tidy.txt contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
From the description of the variable in the original site (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#)

I know that for each record in the dataset it is provided: 
  - Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
  - Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
  - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
  - Its activity label. 
  - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

so the available variables are:

  Subject: a number indicating the subject on which the measures are based
  
  Activity:  the six activities performed by each person(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
  
  The averages for each variable mentioned above, declined in three axes x, y, z.
